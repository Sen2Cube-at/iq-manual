Sen2Cube.at is the first operational semantic Earth Observation data cube, allowing users to extract information from satellite imagery on a higher semantic level. That means, getting answers to questions as *< put some examples here >*, without the need for an expert understanding of the raw image data.

The Sen2Cube.at semantic image querying system is accessible through a [web-interface](https://demo.sen2cube.at/app), in which queries can be formulated by intuitively combining several building blocks, that each represent a unique, distinct part of the querying process. This manual contains the reference documentation of that interface.

Sen2cube.at is provided by **Z_GIS**, the Department of Geoinformatics at the University of Salzburg, in collaboration with project partners.
