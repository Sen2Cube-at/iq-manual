["index.html", "Sen2Cube.at Manual 1 About", " Sen2Cube.at Manual 2020-07-10 1 About   Sen2Cube.at is the first operational semantic Earth Observation data cube, allowing users to extract information from satellite imagery on a higher semantic level. That means, getting answers to questions as insert examples , without the need for an expert understanding of the raw image data. The Sen2Cube.at semantic image querying system is accessible through a web-interface, in which queries can be formulated by intuitively combining several building blocks, that each represent a distinct, clearly defined task or value inside the querying process. This manual contains the reference documentation of that interface. Sen2cube.at is provided by Z_GIS, the Department of Geoinformatics at the University of Salzburg, in collaboration with project partners.           The product is developed with support by the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) under the Austrian Space Application Programme (ASAP 14) within the project Sen2Cube.at (project no.: 866016).   "]
