That means, getting answers to questions such as “Which images are cloud-free in a specific area-of-interest?”, “What was the phenology of this agricultural field in 2019?”, “Which areas were permanently sealed in the last year?” and many more. To obtain these results you don’t need programming or be an expert with deeper knowledge of the raw image data. The Sen2Cube.at semantic image querying system is accessible through a web-interface, in which queries can be formulated by intuitively combining several building blocks, that each represent a distinct, clearly defined task or value inside the querying process. This manual contains the reference documentation of that interface. Sen2Cube.at is provided by Z_GIS, the Department of Geoinformatics at the University of Salzburg, in collaboration with project partners.           The product is developed with support by the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) under the Austrian Space Application Programme (ASAP 14) within the project Sen2Cube.at (project no.: 866016).   1.2 Use cases Sen2Cube.at is designed as a general-purpose Earth observation expert system to support and facilitate a great variety of use-cases. The ones listed here are selected as introduction. "]
